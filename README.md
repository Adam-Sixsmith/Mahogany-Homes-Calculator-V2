# Mahogany-Homes-Calculator-V2
Second edition to my Mahogany Homes Calculator 
 

The first edition of my Mahogany Home Calculator needed the player/user to input the total amount of xp they needed to hit a certain level. 

For example, if you wanted to get level 99 you would need to put in 13034431. In practise this isn't great as not all players know what xp is needed for the given level. 

  

As I'm still learning how to code, I've found that using a dictionary in Python was the best thing to do, so I've created a separate file with all the levels and their xp requirements from level 1 to 99 

I can now use my main code to pull from this data, and also use this for any other calculators I make moving forward that require the levels and xp needed.
